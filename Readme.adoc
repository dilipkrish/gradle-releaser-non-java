== Using it for non-java projects
1. https://github.com/dilipkrish/gradle-releaser-non-java/blob/master/settings.gradle#L18[Rename the project] in the settings.gradle
2. Add the .version file with a version (currently uses maven convention) e.g. 0.9.1-SNAPSHOT
3. Tag the the repository with an annotated tag

[source,bash]
----
git tag -a 0.9.1 -m "Bootstrapping version"
----

4. Generate the property file for snapshot builds

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew generateBuildPropertyFile
----

4. Generate the property file in team city. Note that we bundled running sonar when we do release builds. The `-x sonarqube` skips running that task.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew buildReleaseCandidate -x sonarqube
----

5. The build files will be generated with the right metadata in `build/build.properties` folder
